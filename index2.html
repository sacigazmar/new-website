      <p class="text"><span>In the series DOUBLE DATE from 1996 human models amuse themselves in a virtual world of entertainment. These are collages of elements that evoke memories of Dadaism and Surrealism, movements that greatly appeal to Micha Klein, especially in terms of mentality, playfulness and the desire to experiment.

      <p class="title text"><span>ARTIFICIAL BEAUTIES</span></p>
      <p class="text"><span>A subtle commentary on the female ideal of beauty constitutes his latest series of photographic works, ARTIFICIAL BEAUTY (1998), which also inaugurates a new style. After the exuberant virtual fantasy world of KLEIN'S GOODIES SHOW and the spectacular combinations of men and virtual spaces, these "artificial beauties" are very restrained. The new series consists it five portraits of more than perfect faces, set against a background of shimmering, crystalline space flowers and swirling geometric shapes. The equally enchanting and inhuman beauty of the portraits, which bear and confusing resemblance, is the result of combining the face of Klein's friend Afke with that of a different photo model each time. The ultimate, digital plastic surgery that leads to a perfection that seems to be attractive, but makes one feel as uneasy as the beauty of faces of older movie stars smoothed on the operating table.
        <br>"ARTIFICIAL BEAUTY is totally over the top, just like that cheerful older work, there is always an edge to it. My work is very accessible, but there are always all kinds of references in it, so it works on several levels, at least that's what I try to achieve."</span>

    <p class="text"><span>
      Foucault's 'subject' seems to be produced through discourse in two different senses or places. First, the discourse itself produces 'subjects' - figures who personify the particular forms of knowledge which the discourse produces. These subjects have the attributes we would expect as these are defined by the discourse: the madman, the hysterical woman, the homosexual, the individualized criminal, and so on. These figures are specific to specific discursive regimes and historical periods. But the discourse also produces a place for the subject (i.e. the reader or viewer, who is also 'subjected to' discourse) from which its particular knowledge and meaning most makes sense. It is not inevitable that all individuals in a particular period will become the subjects of a particular discourse in this sense, and thus the bearers of its power/knowledge. But for them - us - to do so, they - we ­ must locate themselves/ourselves in the position from which the discourse makes most sense, and thus become its 'subjects' by 'subjecting' ourselves to its meanings, power and regulation. All discourses, then, construct subject- positions, from which alone they make sense.

  <p class="title text"><span>DO YOU BELIEVE IN USERS?</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span>In an ideal world, we would love to skip this introduction – or at least the most difficult part of it, where we, as authors have to define the term used in the book’s title.
    Isn’t it enough to put a unicorn on the cover, throw a bit of Comic Sans over it and announce a chapter on LOLCATS in the table of contents? You would know what we mean.
    But sharing our fascination with amateur digital culture is only half of the business at hand. The Grand Plan, to which this book is only a tiny contribution, is to truly reconnect users and computers, users and developers, users and the history of their favorite medium. If this plan works out, perhaps a reasonable relationship between computers and people could be restored.
    The personal computer (a meta medium), and the Internet (aka network of the networks), are mistakenly regarded as mere extensions of pre-computer culture. Net, web, media, computer, digital, are the miserable and inadequate prefixes still used to indicate that something was produced with a computer, was maybe digitized or can be accessed through a computer interface. A lot of effort is put into increasing the “fidelity,” “realism” and “emotion” of the “content” rushing through digital circuits, and these efforts are almost always praised. These perceived improvements however are likely to wipe out the very reality and emotion that is living inside the
    computer. It seems that in spite of its prevalence in our culture, the computer’s ultimate purpose is to become an invisible “appliance", transparent interface and device denying any characteristics of its own. Most computing power is used in an attempt to make people forget about computers. Thus, the often heard statement that computers are a common thing in today’s world is a fallacy. Never before has computer technology been so widely spread and computer culture been so underdeveloped in relation.

  <p class="title text"><span>THE RISE OF THE META ME</p></span>
  <p class="text"><span>We rely on our digital selves to communicate with others, to form our offline identities, and to understand each other and the world around us. We are entering into an era where the human identity becomes an inseparable composite of both digital and physical. So what does the world look like after those selves have merged?
    <br>This symbiotic human-machine, something I call the Meta Me, is the co-mingling of our digital and analog selves. It takes the modern human being and attaches a digital construct, resulting in a unified, fully integrated digital self. Carried to the ideal, it becomes a studied, intentional extension of ourselves—an extension that we’ve actively invested in. You can instrument your digital self to be the very thing you need to be at any time: the funniest guy at the party, the best conversationalist in an interview, the most charming version of yourself on a first date.
    <br>There is no longer a separate native self that can realistically be considered independent of the digital self.</span></p>

  <p class="title text"><span>VIRTUALISTIC</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span>It is striking that Klein does not so much contemplate and moralize, but first and 
    foremost identifies and registers. His work is not a reflection on contemporary youth 
    culture from 'outside' or 'above', but arises directly from it. The world that hit to virtuality in 
    the quadriptych is also his world. He turns out not only to recognize the seductions of this 
    world, but also to fathom its essence. Therein lies the cultural-historical significance of 
    VIRTUALISTIC. The artistic significance of the series and Klein's other work lies in the 
    original visual qualities and complete mastery of the technique at his disposal.
  <br>In the series VIRTUALISTIC VIBES - a fashion reportage for WAVE magazine - in which photographed people feature for the first time, this conflict between seduction and unease is taken to the extreme. The four-part series can so far be considered a key work within Micha Klein's oeuvre. The series VIRTUALISTIC VIBES confronts the viewer with beckoning or daring looking men and women: the eye contact is immediate and inescapable. Through the three-dimensional suggestion, this side and that side, reality and virtuality are only separated by the thin layer of perspex. In the almost classical way in which - otherwise extremely contemporary - pictorial motifs are used, characters are part of narrative settings, the four panels can be regarded as contemporary genre pieces with an emblematic slant. On the one hand, they resemble modern - not lacking in humor - translations of the four temperaments, while on the other, they are accurate characterisations of today's youth culture.

  <p class="title text"><span>POP</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span>An important source of inspiration for Micha Klein is contemporary pop music. His interest 
    in current house music and the related "house scene" has in recent years been expressed 
    mainly in his activities as a VJ (video jockey). During dance and music evenings in 
    discotheques he presents rhythmic bombardments of image fragments in interaction with 
    music and disc jockeys: mostly short, repetitive "shots". The VJ programs are an essential 
    artistic expression of a generation. With them, the artist placed himself in the vital center 
    of a youth culture.

<div class="fairies"> <img src="assets/images/fairies.JPG">
  <p class="title text"><span>AMONGST ELVES</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span>Very remarkable images, all the more so because here he breaks a truly twentieth century taboo. For years, for almost a century these fairy-tale figures have been unwelcome in art. Where once in the Baroque period they were everyday appearances as babies and angels, in the last century, after 
    having figured in the harems of a painter like Ingres and in the playful water and air 
    scenes of Bouguereau, they were banished forever to the sphere of kitsch. Even the 
    attempts by painters like Johfra in the 1960s and 1970s to bring them, as fairies, back into 
    art failed. But nobody can ignore the scenes Micha K. depicts here with the same fauns 
    and elves that inspired a variety of artists in the last century. Now the hedonism of the 
    years around the turn of our century, in which the half-naked boys and girls in 
    transvestism express the ambiguity of excess, is depicted in a very telling way. In which 
    Micha K., despite being the eternal optimist that he is, cannot help but let the shadow side 
    of it shine through, as it is. In order to remind us that these forms, entangled in 
    exuberant choreographies, not only stand for the artistic atmosphere of the doors of 
    perception, but also testify to the thinking that has been shaken loose by smart drugs and 
    other hallucinogens. In his elf and faun world, Micha K. shows how today we can hardly 
    define the boundary between artistic hallucinations and the evil dream of the body-
    addicting spheres. And that is a thought as enlightening as it is disturbing.

  <p class="title text"><span>AD FOR PHILIPS FIRST PLASMA TV,</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span>Art as advertising or advertising as art, it is a dividing line that sometimes becomes almost 
    completely blurred in Micha Klein's work, without in any way detracting from the power of 
    his images, which effortlessly fulfill his desire to create "seductive images that can stand 
    up to the visual violence of other media." He makes use of the visual language of that 
    visual violence, such as advertising, but translates that language to such an extreme that 
    his images become in their immoderate perfection and ironic commentary, not to say 
    parody of the visual conventions to which they refer.
    <br>"I have also made TV leads, CD covers and quite a lot of advertising - KPN, Mustang, 
    Philips, Marlboro and so on - so I have an agent for my commercial work. Advertising work 
    is necessary in order to keep going and keep up with technology and free work, otherwise 
    it's over. But it's also interesting in a way. I now get OK commissions that are specifically 
    tailored to the discoveries I've made in my free work. That is why it is so important to continue with that. Nobody asks for it, that's always the case with free art. But that's 
    where the innovations come from, the innovations."

    creating a separate identity in the world of art, separating it from one’s personal life
    <br>treating one’s artist work as a project, rather than a part of one’s self
    <br>what consequences it can bring if one separates their work so visibly from their own persona?

    <br>how deeply our given name identifies us?
    <br>for many years i couldn’t pinpoint why but i hated when people called me by my given name, Sára. i felt a bit ashamed and hurt at the same time but never understood why. i was around the age of 10 when my new friend started calling me Saci just because she wanted to call me by a different name than everybody else does. i felt this weird happiness and relief when she started using it more and other people took it over as well. by now everyone (besides my family) calls me by my nickname, i introduce myself as Saci and people often think its my given name.
    i’m still not exactly sure why i felt (and still sometimes feel) repulsed by the idea of being called by my own name but its comforting that at least i got a solution in a way to go around it.

<div class="shiny">  
  <p class="title note">why are we attracted to the shine?</p>
  <p class="note">
  many times i catch myself appreciating shiny and sparkly things over other finishes. i always thought this is somehow connected to our inner child but according to some research papers i found, it can simply be linked to the fundamental basic need of fresh water (which is crazy for me).
  <br>in many virtual and imaginary worlds things are more shiny and plastic-looking to be more attractive to the viewer who is longing to get away from the naturally occurring surroundings, resulting in a highly fake looking environment.
  <br>for me its also interesting to see these approaches being translated back into the real wold (e.g. in terms of clothing, household items, unnecessary levels of decorating objects until the point that they nearly loose their function).

<div class="beauty_ideals">  
  <p class="note">
    beauty trends and ideals are one of the most toxic and counterproductive concepts that i can think of. over-representing a singular physical appearance is not only fake but harmful at the same time. as long as they can remain a source of inspiration they can be actually useful but no further than that i think. it somehow scares me when i see a group of people and they all look almost the same, hence i could appreciate Micha Klein’s approach so much in the ARTIFICIAL BEAUTIES series.

<div class="imaginary">  
  <p class="note">
    imaginary worlds feel like an escape from reality, something you long for and can’t wait to enter one way or an other. it doesn’t necessarily matter how you get there (through a movie, video game, book, substances etc.) but it fills you with an euphoric feeling that you cannot reach in the real world. 
  <br>but what do you miss in the real world that is so far out of reach?
  <br>what do i miss?

<div class="fairy_notes">  
  <p class="note">
    fairies are a complex yet easily depicted symbol in my view: their bodies are based on a human body but with an extra feature of the wings representing the untouchable state of their “evolution”. they convey escapism is my eyes, especially in an early age of our existence. sometimes i like to think about them as something that brings me back to my past, lightens up my inner child and at the same time suggest something that is yet to come or might even never come at all.

<div class="first">  
  <p class="note">
    it was interesting for me to see that even the first image uploaded to the internet was a digital representation of the self, even though it could have been anything else. 
    <br>uploading images of ourselves to the internet is quite a weird concept if you think about it. building our digital identity in a way creates distance between one’s original identity and the new online one but at the same time it becomes valid while being built because it slowly becomes a part of us. can they even be separated and discussed individually?
