      human models amuse themselves in a virtual world of entertainment. These are collages of elements that evoke memories of Dadaism and Surrealism, movements that greatly appeal to Micha Klein, especially in terms of mentality, playfulness and the desire to experiment.</span>

      <p class="text"><span>A subtle commentary on the female ideal of beauty constitutes his latest series of photographic works, ARTIFICIAL BEAUTY (1998), which also inaugurates a new style. After the exuberant virtual fantasy world of KLEIN'S GOODIES SHOW and the spectacular combinations of men and virtual spaces, these "artificial beauties" are very restrained. The new series consists it five portraits of more than perfect faces, set against a background of shimmering, crystalline space flowers and swirling geometric shapes. The equally enchanting and inhuman beauty of the portraits, which bear and confusing resemblance, is the result of combining the face of Klein's friend Afke with that of a different photo model each time. The ultimate, digital plastic surgery that leads to a perfection that seems to be attractive, but makes one feel as uneasy as the beauty of faces of older movie stars smoothed on the operating table."ARTIFICIAL BEAUTY is totally over the top, just like that cheerful older work, there is always an edge to it. My work is very accessible, but there are always all kinds of references in it, so it works on several levels, at least that's what I try to achieve.</span>

    <p class="text"><span>Where, then, is 'the subject' in this more discursive approach to meaning. representation and power?
      Foucault's 'subject' seems to be produced through discourse in two different senses or places. First, the discourse itself produces 'subjects' - figures who personify the particular forms of knowledge which the discourse produces. These subjects have the attributes we would expect as these are defined by the discourse: the madman, the hysterical woman, the homosexual, the individualized criminal, and so on. These figures are specific to specific discursive regimes and historical periods. But the discourse also produces a place for the subject (i.e. the reader or viewer, who is also 'subjected to' discourse) from which its particular knowledge and meaning most makes sense. It is not inevitable that all individuals in a particular period will become the subjects of a particular discourse in this sense, and thus the bearers of its power/knowledge. But for them - us - to do so, they - we ­ must locate themselves/ourselves in the position from which the discourse makes most sense, and thus become its 'subjects' by 'subjecting' ourselves to its meanings, power and regulation. All discourses, then, construct subject- positions, from which alone they make sense.

  <p class="title text"><span>DO YOU BELIEVE IN USERS?</span></p>
  <p class="text"><span>In an ideal world, we would love to skip this introduction – or at least the most difficult part of it, where we, as authors have to define the term used in the book’s title.
    Isn’t it enough to put a unicorn on the cover, throw a bit of Comic Sans over it and announce a chapter on LOLCATS in the table of contents? You would know what we mean.
    But sharing our fascination with amateur digital culture is only half of the business at hand. The Grand Plan, to which this book is only a tiny contribution, is to truly reconnect users and computers, users and developers, users and the history of their favorite medium. If this plan works out, perhaps a reasonable relationship between computers and people could be restored.
    The personal computer(a meta medium), and the Internet aka network of the networks), are mistakenly regarded as mere extensions of pre-computer culture. Net, web, media, computer, digital, are the miserable and inadequate prefixes still used to indicate that something was produced with a computer, was maybe digitized or can be accessed through a computer interface. A lot of effort is put into increasing the “fidelity,” “realism” and “emotion” of the “content” rushing through digital circuits, and these efforts are almost always praised. These perceived improvements however are likely to wipe out the very reality and emotion that is living inside the
    computer. It seems that in spite of its prevalence in our culture, the computer’s ultimate purpose is to become an invisible “appliance, transparent interface and device denying any characteristics of its own. Most computing power is used in an attempt to make people forget about computers. Thus, the often heard statement that computers are a common thing in today’s world is a fallacy. Never before has computer technology been so widely spread and computer culture been so underdeveloped in relation.

  <p class="title text"><span>THE RISE OF THE META ME</p></span>
  <p class="text"><span>We rely on our digital selves to communicate with others, to form our offline identities, and to understand each other and the world around us. We are entering into an era where the human identity becomes an inseparable composite of both digital and physical. So what does the world look like after those selves have merged?
    <br>This symbiotic human-machine, something I call the Meta Me, is the co-mingling of our digital and analog selves. It takes the modern human being and attaches a digital construct, resulting in a unified, fully integrated digital self. Carried to the ideal, it becomes a studied, intentional extension of ourselves—an extension that we’ve actively invested in. You can instrument your digital self to be the very thing you need to be at any time: the funniest guy at the party, the best conversationalist in an interview, the most charming version of yourself on a first date.
    <br>There is no longer a separate native self that can realistically be considered independent of the digital self.</span></p>
